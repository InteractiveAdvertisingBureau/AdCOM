# OVERVIEW <a name="Overview"></a>

## OpenMedia Mission <a name="openmediamission"></a>

The mission of the OpenMedia project is to spur growth in programmatic marketplaces by providing open industry standards for communication between buyers of advertising and sellers of publisher inventory. There are several aspects to these standards including but not limited to real-time bidding, ad and creative management, information taxonomies, and many more.

Over recent years, multiple IAB standards have reached considerable levels of success in the industry. OpenMedia is the umbrella that pulls these standards into a coherent landscape and in doing so, it has become clear that there are many core concepts that are overlapping from these multiple specifications. This document presents a standard that formalizes these common concepts for reuse by other standards so that they can focus on their distinctiveness and practitioners can find it easier to build systems that use multiple aspects of OpenMedia.

## AdCOM Executive Summary <a name="execsummary"></a>

One of the most successful IAB standards is OpenRTB. This protocol for conducting real-time auctions among sell-side exchanges and demand-side bidders first launched as OpenRTB v1.0 Mobile in February 2011.  Later that year, OpenRTB v2.0 was released, which provided a unified protocol for mobile, display, and video. Due to widespread industry adoption, OpenRTB was established as an IAB standard in January 2012 with the release of version v2.1 although governance over technical content remained with the OpenRTB community. Since then and true to its initial objective, OpenRTB has become the *lingua franca* of real-time programmatic advertising and entered 2018 as v2.5.

During these years, programmatic advertising has become a dominant force in the industry. However, this has also led to an increasingly complex supply chain which may increase fraud rates and other risks. This is one of the key motivators driving OpenRTB v3.0 since the level of change needed to meet the challenges of programmatic currently and going forward could not be accomplished in a backward compatible manner (i.e., as an additional v2.x release).

Combined with the OpenMedia goal of rationalizing the IAB standards portfolio, this has led to a layered approach, where OpenRTB will focus on the actual media commerce transaction (e.g., auction parameters, deals, bids, etc.) while the concepts in common with other specifications (e.g., ads, placements, users, devices, sites, publishers, etc.) will be factored into its own reusable specification. Thus the genesis of the Advertising Common Object Model or AdCOM.

In addition to providing the modularity to benefit specifications in addition to OpenRTB, AdCOM seeks to address other business challenges of programmatic advertising. For example, publishers currently have limited ability to control the types of creatives they run on their properties due to the opaque nature in which traditional display ads are conveyed. Many types of undesirable creatives make their way to publisher content such as overly heavy payloads, those lacking of brand safety, excessive pixel fires, and JavaScript that launches malware.

These and other problematic behaviors result in poor and potentially damaging user experiences, diminished user trust, installation of ad blockers, erosion of publisher monetization, and the increased challenge for good actors on the advertiser side to reach their intended audience. AdCOM attempts to address these challenges by supporting new and safer structured ad formats.

Reusability by multiple IAB specifications positions AdCOM to leverage solutions such as this across a range of industry applications.

## Version History <a name="versionhistory"></a>

1.0	Original Release of AdCOM; the Advertising Common Object Model.

# ARCHITECTURE <a name="architecture"></a>

This section describes the OpenMedia specification landscape, the role AdCOM plays, its overall structure, and the principles that guide the usage and extensibility of the AdCOM specification.

## OpenMedia Layers <a name="openmedialayers"></a>

To assist in reuse of objects across different specifications and to enable specifications to evolve at different paces, a layered approach is being adopted. Expressed informally, Layer-1 moves bytes among parties, Layer-2 expresses the language of these bytes, Layer-3 specifies a transaction using this language, and Layer-4 describes the concepts being transacted.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1RN-UxDGvP4F1ECiVvHl7BJODBh2oi0uZ)

Given this layered concept, the IAB Tech Lab has defined an overall organization of related specifications as "OpenMedia". The landscape of these specifications and how they may be organized into protocol layers is illustrated as follows.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1oJ7_sDwDzVKbu3vXXIifjc-Ki7LiOkvI)

There are a number of objects that are common to multiple transaction specifications. For example, both OpenRTB and OpenDirect share a common concept of a "site", a "placement", an "ad", and other so-called domain objects. These objects describe the subject of a transaction; those concepts upon which the transaction operates. Factoring them into their own model enables multiple transaction protocol specifications to reuse these common objects rather than each of them redefining similar but needlessly different versions of core concepts.

## AdCOM Principles <a name="adcomprinciples"></a>

The following points define the guiding principles underlying the AdCOM specification, some of its basic rules, and its evolution.

* AdCOM is backwards compatible within minor versions (e.g. 1.x to 1.y). No breaking changes may be made within a minor revision (e.g., no removal of attributes or objects, name or type changes, or redefinition of semantics). New objects and attributes may be added and enumerated lists may be extended and thus implementers must accept these types of changes without breakage.

* Object and attribute names have been made intentionally compact while still trying to balance readability. The reason for this is that in applications like OpenRTB where JSON is still widely used, these names may be transmitted in plain text extremely frequently.

* When using AdCOM, transaction specifications (e.g. OpenRTB) must indicate the version of AdCOM in use and specify where and how it interfaces with AdCOM objects.

* AdCOM imposes no specific representation on its objects. This document uses JSON for illustration purposes, but this is not intended to imply any representational requirement or language binding.

* All AdCOM objects may be extended as needed for vendor-specific applications. Extensions to an AdCOM object must always be placed within a subordinate "ext" object. Most enumerated lists when indicated can also be extended to include vendor-specific codes typically starting at 500.

* The typical process of promoting a new AdCOM object, attribute, or list value into future specification versions is either when a substantial concept is discovered that is applicable to multiple transaction specifications or when vendor-specific extensions become widely adopted.

# SPECIFICATION <a name="spec"></a>

This section contains the detailed AdCOM domain layer specification. Unless explicitly specified otherwise, annotated as optional, or called out as a best practice, all material aspects of this section are required for AdCOM compliance.

Throughout the object specifications, attributes may be indicated as "Required" or "Recommended". Attributes are deemed *required* only if their omission would break the technical meaning of the object and is not necessarily an indicator of business value otherwise. Attributes are *recommended* when their omission would not break the object, but would dramatically diminish its value. Transaction layers in which AdCOM is used may provide additional *required* and/or *recommended* guidance specific to the application.

From a specification compliance perspective, any attribute not denoted *required* is optional, whether *recommended* or not. An optional attribute may have a default value to be assumed if omitted. If no default is indicated, then by convention its absence should be interpreted as *unknown*, unless otherwise specified. Empty strings or null values should be interpreted the same as omitted (i.e., the default if one is specified or *unknown* otherwise).

AdCOM is a collection of object classes with various relationships among them. However, there are distinct groups into which these classes are partitioned. The figure below identifies these groups as *Media*, *Placement*, and *Context*. This is purely a means of organization; no technical distinctions or restrictions are implied.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1K5erLjElcSJFLPYbcByQsljS2il-O_bC)

The Media group comprises objects that define an actual ad, including reference to its creative and metadata to enable proper rendering, restrictions compliance, event tracking, and quality auditing.

The Placement group comprises objects that define the set of allowed ads and behaviors for a given placement. This might include mechanical information (e.g., sizes, supported mime types, and other rendering options), placement details and positioning, and various restrictions lists.

Finally, the Context group comprises objects that represent concepts that are interacting, presenting, enclosing, or are otherwise relating to the world in which impressions live.  These include the user, their device, their location, the ad distribution channel (e.g., site, app, digital out-of-home) with which they are interacting, the channel's publisher, its content, and any regulations that are in effect.

Note: As a convention in this document, objects being defined are denoted with uppercase first letter in deference to the common convention for class names in programming languages such as Java, whereas actual instances of objects and references thereto are lowercase.

## Media Objects <a name="mediaobjects"></a>

The Media group of objects defines an actual ad including reference to its creative and metadata to enable proper rendering, restrictions compliance, event tracking, and quality auditing.

The following figure presents the objects and interrelationships in this group. The objects are defined in the subsections thereafter.

### Object:  Display <a name="object_display"></a>

This object provides additional detail about an ad specifically for display ads. There are multiple attributes for specifying creative details: "banner" for simple banner images "native" for native ads, "adm" for including general markup, and "curl" for referencing general markup via URL. In any given "Display" object, only one of these attributes should be used to avoid confusion. To the extent feasible, structured objects should be favored over general markup for quality and safety issues.

## Placement Objects <a name="placementobjects"></a>

The Placement group includes objects that define the set of allowed ads for a given impression. This can include mechanical information (e.g., sizes, supported mime types and other rendering options), placement details and positioning, various restrictions lists (e.g., advertiser domains, content categories), and more.

The following figure presents the objects and interrelationships in this group. The objects are defined in the subsections thereafter.

## Context Objects <a name="contextobjects"></a>

This group of objects represent concepts that are interacting, presenting, enclosing, or are otherwise relating to the world in which impressions live. These include the user, their device, their location, the channel (e.g., site, app, digital out-of-home) with which they are interacting, the channel's publisher, its content, and any regulations that are in effect (e.g., COPPA, GDPR).

The following figure presents the objects and interrelationships in this group. The objects are defined in the subsections thereafter.

### Abstract Class:  DistributionChannel <a name="abstract_distributionchannel"></a>

A distribution channel is an abstraction of the various types of entities or channels through which ads are distributed. Examples include websites, mobile apps, and digital out-of-home (DOOH) systems. This generalized class contains those attributes and relationships that are common to all distribution channels and as such, all of its attributes and relationships are inherited by each of its derived classes.

Note: As an abstract class, a DistributionChannel is never instantiated on its own. Only objects of its derived classes are actually realized.

### Object:  Geo <a name="object_geo"></a>

This object encapsulates various methods for specifying a geographic location. When subordinate to a "Device" object, it indicates the location of the device which can also be interpreted as the user's current location. When subordinate to a "User" object, it indicates the location of the user's home base (i.e., not necessarily their current location).

The "lat" and "lon" attributes should only be passed if they conform to the accuracy depicted in the "type" attribute. For example, the centroid of a large region (e.g., postal code) should not be passed.

# Appendix B:  Change Log <a name="appendixb_changelog"></a>

This appendix serves as an index of specification changes from the current version to the previous. These changes pertain only to the substance of the specification and not routine document formatting, information organization, or content without technical impact.

Since v1.0 is the initial version of AdCOM, the change log is omitted.

# Appendix C:  OpenRTB Interfaces <a name="appendixc_openrtbinterfaces"></a>

As [OpenRTB v3.0+](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/openrtb) is a very popular transaction layer that uses AdCOM, this appendix is provided to show the interface between the two specifications. This is presented here as informational only; please refer to the current OpenRTB specification v3.0+ for official details on OpenRTB.

In the JSON snippets that follow, AdCOM objects are shown within OpenRTB payloads. The ellipses indicate attributes unrelated to this example that have been omitted for brevity.

## Request Context <a name="requestcontext"></a>

The following is an abbreviated example of an OpenRTB v3.x bid request. It self-identifies as OpenRTB and shows its version as "3.0". It also shows that it is using AdCOM v1.0 as its domain layer.

The "context" object is the OpenRTB interface to AdCOM context objects. It can contain any of the top-level context objects, all of which are optional, and their subordinates. This example includes top-level objects "regs", "site" (no more than one distribution channel subtype may be included), "user", and "device".

This example is indicating a mobile optimized website and some basic details about the site and its publisher. The user is a female born in 1990. She is using an Apple iPhone 6S, running iOS 11.4.1, and is connected via the Verizon network. Her device (and presumably she) is currently located in Boston MA, USA, during eastern standard time.
```
{
	"openrtb": {

				}
			}
			...
		}
	}
}
```

## Item Specifications <a name="itemspecs"></a>

The following snippet is an abbreviated OpenRTB v3.x bid request that offers a single item for sale.

The "spec" object within an "item" is the OpenRTB interface to AdCOM placement objects. It contains one "Placement" top-level object and its subordinates.

This example is indicating a display placement that must be secure. Either a structured banner or AMPHTML is acceptable and if the latter, the AMP rendering mode will be *early*. The placement is not interstitial, two possible sizes are offered (i.e., 320x50 and 320x250), and a simple pixel tracker for the impression event is supported.
```
{
  "openrtb": {
		...
		"request": {
			...
			"item": [
				{
					...
					"spec": {
						"placement": {
							"tagid": "plc-ftr-123abc",
							"secure": 1,
							"display": {
								"ctype": [ 2, 3 ],
								"ampren": 0,
								"instl": 0,
								"displayfmt": [
									{
										"w": 320, "h": 50
									},
									{
										"w": 320, "h": 250
									}
								],
								"event": [
									{
										"type": 1, "method": 1
									}
								]
							}
						}
					}
					...
				}
			]
			...
		}
	}
}
```

## Media Response <a name="mediaresponse"></a>

The following is an abbreviated example of an OpenRTB v3.x bid response. It self-identifies as OpenRTB and shows its version as "3.0". It also shows that it is using AdCOM v1.0 as its domain layer.

The "media" object is the OpenRTB interface to AdCOM media objects. It contains one "Ad" top-level object and its subordinates.

This example is indicating a secure display ad for Ford using a structured banner object with a 320x50 JPEG creative. A pixel tracker for the impression rendering event is requested.
```
{
	"openrtb": {
		"ver": "3.0",
		"domainspec": "adcom", "domainver": "1.0",
		"response": {
			...
			"seatbid": [
				{
					...
					"bid": [
						{
							...
							"media": {
								"ad": {
									"id": "d0bcb39723af87c2bb00942afee5710e",
									"adomain": [ "ford.com" ],
									"cid": "campaign-xyz.123",
									"secure": 1,
									"display": {
										"mime": "image/jpeg",
										"type": 3, "w": 320, "h": 50,
										"banner": {
											"img": "https://somebuyer.com/creative",
											"link: "https://somebuyer.com/click"
										},
										"event": [
											{
												"type": 1, "method": 1,
												"url": "https://somebuyer.com/pixel"
											}
										]
									}
								}
							}
							...
						}
					]
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```
